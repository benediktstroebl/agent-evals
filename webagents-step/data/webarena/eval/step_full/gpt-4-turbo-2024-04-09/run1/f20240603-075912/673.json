Just fish tailing down the road.I did give it 2 stars cause the quality isn't bad. Pretty sturdy, and the feel is nice. But the damn thing didn't even come with instructions, just how to plug it in. Nothing on how to set up the dead zone and sensitivity. Guess it didn't come with it cause it didn't help much to change it.... Gonna try to sell it and get some money back to purchase a higher end wheel.Basically, don't waste your money on this if you are looking for more precision to steer...\"",

Tried for a good bit to see if it was just cause I wasn't used to using it. After an hour, I was literally disgusted. Even setting it to 270 degrees, when you'd turn the wheel about 20 degrees, you'd be at full left or right.... No way could I even keep the car straight doing 50 mph, let alone 200...
