It gives great print quality as long as you use the premium paper settings (doesn't actually have to be the premium paper) and set it to high quality. Printing standard quality on plain paper is really only good enough for printing documents, online tickets, things like that.I make & sell stickers, greeting cards, etc, and I've used this printer for that since my WF 7620 had a printhead go bad - which cost nearly as much to replace as the printer itself. The 3620 has done well, but like all printers, they now have designed obsolescence so they all have issues eventually. Recently it started being unable to align the printheads even after running numerous alignments and the colors are no longer coming out correctly. I started having those color issues about 8 months in but I was able to work around it for a while by adjusting the color settings, now no amount of adjustments corrects it. Tons of head cleans haven't fixed the issue so I'm replacing it with an EcoTank model - because this printer goes through ink cartridges like crazy. I do print a lot, probably 20 or more pages a week on average, and I buy cartridges about every month or two which gets really expensive and ends up being several hundred dollars a year in cartridges.Horrible ink cost (but kind of typical)I had no issues setting up the wifi - works great.The scan feature works great, I love that it can scan straight to PDF for documents.I've never used any devices other than my PC to print from it so I can't comment on print anywhere featuresI have no issues with the menu or buttonsI have had paper jam issues, where the paper doesn't actually jam, it just doesn't want to pull a sheet out of the tray. Usually if I open/close the tray and tell it to try again it resolves the issue.I had issues with my WF 7620 denting the end of the paper when pulling it from the tray and causing jams - this printer did not have that issue.This printer has never sat unused for more than a couple of days, so I have never had any issues with ink drying out.Print speed for plain documents is really fast, print speed for high quality photo type prints is much slower but I found it to be as expected for any printer laying down that much ink and detail.This printer is a good size, not hard to move around and not terribly heavy. One person can do it. The WF 7620 I had previously has a large scanner bed so that printer is a nightmare to move compared to this printer - it can be moved by one person but I don't recommend it if you like your back the way it is.I have printed on 110 lb card stock from the paper tray with little to no feed issues (other than the one feed issue that happens with any paper I put in)I have printed glossy sticker paper with the only issue being the leading edge of the image sometimes smudges but only if there's a lot of dark ink at the top of the page.Plain paper printed with no issuesGlossy holographic card stock printed with no issues.The only paper I have had consistently jam in this printer is Silhouette's sticker paper - no idea why, as it isn't any thicker than my glossy sticker paper from LDAll in all, for what I originally paid for it, it has done its job and served me well. I've worked it hard, and it held up to a lot of abuse.Attached pictures are items that were printed on this printer, greeting card, stickers, bookmarker (laminated after printing on matte cardstock)\"\n\t\t\t\t[3537] StaticText 'Review by '\n\t\t\t\t[3539] StaticText 'GoldfishGoldfish'\n\t\t\t\t[3542] StaticText 'Posted on '\n\t\t\t\t[3543] time ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[3675] StaticText '4/20/23'\n\t\t\t\t[3544] StaticText 'Printer heads clog quickly and cannot be unclogged easily'\n\t\t\t\t[3500] LayoutTable ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[3545] LayoutTableRow ''\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[3676] LayoutTableCell 'Rating'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[3677] generic '20%'\n\t\t\t\t[3548] StaticText \"I tried using an Epson printer years ago. My first computer printer was an Epson, in fact. I didn't have much luck with it then, but tried Epson again after learning that they are cheap to operate due to the cheap cost of their inkjet cartridges. Unfortunately, it seems that Epson printers clog up and cannot be unclogged using the printer's normal functions. Some claim you can remove part of the printing mechanism and clean it manually by soaking it, but honestly, I don't care to take the chance on damaging the machine. This might be a good choice for someone who prints every day, especially since it can be operated more cheaply than most printers, but it isn't for me.

THERE'S A REASON....ACTUALLY, SEVERAL REASONS. Overall, it's a poorly designed piece of junk that does not perform reliably. It's consistent, but unfortunately consistently lousy .Changing ink cartridges successfully has been a constant challenge. It won't recognize replacement ink cartridges..Epson or clone...about half the time. When working in a home office without other printers to turn to, that alone is reason to take a sledge hammer to this piece of junk.The default setting is for two sided printing. I couldn't find how to change the default. Called customer service, and through very broken English was told there was no way to change their arbitrary 2-sided default other than to manually uncheck 2-sided printing in the printer dialogue box MANUALLY FOR EVERY SINGLE DOCUMENT YOU WANT TO PRINT. I found it hard to believe such a moronic process was the only option, so the following week I called back again with the same questions....how to set the default to one sided printing and was told the same answer I got on the prior call....in even harder to understand attempts at English language.I should have sent this loser back the first time it wouldn't recognize an Epson cartridge, which was the very first time a cartridge needed replacement....and almost every cartridge change since then. In addition to the recognition problem, the gizmo that holds the ink cartridges is supposed to slide to the left when the machine is opened up, but it sometimes does and sometimes doesn't. If it doesn't, it's very difficult to raise the lid over the cartridges as it's blocked by another part of the printer. Did I mention lousy design??Bottom line: steer clear of anything Epson.

I did A LOT of research for home-office printers and actually this one came very highly rated! I read reviews, I did the consumer reports research, I did it all! However, since the day I bought mine, it hasn\\'t functioned properly! Now I am rating it with 1 star really for the COLOR PRINTING ONLY. I mean, who buys a color printer that can\\'t print in color anyway and expects it to get over 1 star?I went online looking for a customer support phone number; I couldn\\'t find one. So I sent a facebook message to Epson explaining the issue. I needed help quickly and I was hoping they could do it online since most of my experience with technical support for computer stuff has been bad and I\\'m stressed enough. Well, needless to say I think I\\'ve had my intelligence insulted by Epson more times than I can handle. The person basically told me a list of things I should try to AVOID with my Epson printer; I never knew a lot of these things. Apparently their printer works better if you download what you need to print, save it first to your computer then print it-- instead of printing directly off the screen or website.However, the worst was when the person on the phone with customer service (I wanted to avoid this) asked me to take out the ink cartridges and read her the numbers on it (making sure I had installed the right ink to begin with) and then CHECK THE BOTTOM FOR TAPE. I never said it wasn\\'t printing ANY color by the way, I have been saying it prints color POORLY!! So by the end of my conversation she decided I\\'m eligible for a replacement under warranty. However, my printer arrived broken. They want to give me a refurbished one, which I politely explained angered me for a number of reasons. First, my printer still is brand new, and I didn\\'t buy a used printer off Amazon. Second, it arrived this way, it isn\\'t like it all the sudden broke, it\\'s been broken the whole time. I really loved what Epson said though. Her technical support is CLEARLY not customer support because her reasoning behind me getting a refurbished one is laughable, \"it\\'s not like we can resell yours, it\\'s defective\". Well duh! However, what about the NEW ONE that I was promised when I paid money for it? That one I\\'m still kind of waiting for... Well my point is, BUYER BEWARE...DON\\'T BUY THIS PRINTER...

I\\'m pretty sure I haven\\'t yet found every way you can print on this thing - but, I feel safe it\\'s covered.- All the features an AIO needs -scan, fax, copy etc. They are there. They are easy to use and work like they should.The one caveat I always have about Epsons applies here. They tend to live by the \"sell them cheap - and then make lots of $$$ for their life via very pricey printing ink refills\". To get around this, I recommend:- Keep your default on B&W draft/fast for everyday printing,- don\\'t always believe it when it tells you you\\'re running out of ink (often there\\'s plenty to go - and it will print with whatever cartridges have ink if you ask it to),- do a print test of a couple of a few pages before printing out a whole large document or multiple copies of larger documents, and always buy the cartridges with XL in them (T252XL not T252) - for about $10 more they will give you more than 3x the paper. (e.g. T252 = 300 pages, T252XL =1100pages).
