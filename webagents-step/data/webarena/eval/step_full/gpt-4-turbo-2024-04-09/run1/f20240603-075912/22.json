I asked her if that was not covered under the warranty than what was? She told me that only electrical components were covered. I argued with her that there is obviously some sort of manufacturer defect in the product since the lens cover just slid right off. I was basically told that there is a charge to fix the cover and that\\'s that. I asked her that if this same thing happened after I had only had the camera week, would Fuji still not honor the warranty and she said \"yes, I would still have to pay for it even if I had only had it for a week.\" What kind of customer service is this????

I use it a lot and have explored many of the different features it has.Pros:the color is gorgeous! I'm obsessed with pink so I was happy to find such a lovely color in a camera.The build is very sturdy feeling- though my husband DID manage to put a small dent in the front metal cover somehow! So, looks impervious, but it's not.I love how it turns on. Just slide over the front cover and it's ready to go in a few seconds. This is a great feature- Just make sure it's on the photo-mode 'party, outdoors, etc) that you want beforehand.I like museum mode. It mutes the camera, and turns off the flash. And that's come in handy. ('forbidden' pictures in European cathedrals, anyone?)The battery life is good, and it charges fairly quickly. You do have to take out the battery to charge it though.The size is great. I have the case for it too, which is nice.Cons:The picture quality is less than perfect I've found. This is a 10mp camera- the pix should be gorgeous- yet I've never found them to be so. They mostly look good, and produce nice prints, but I've not been very impressed.Focus- Many of the pictures I take look good in the LCD, and when i put them on my computer, they actually look blurry. Many times I have to take 2-3 pictures of the same thing b/c they keep coming out unfocused. I'm not a professional but I flatter myself that I can take a decent photo, standing still! This is probably my biggest complaint with this camera.Couples timer doesn't seem to work so well- it jumps the gun everytime I try it. I like the 10 second timer instead.still haven't figured out how the facial recognition feature benefits me.It's a pain in the [...] to cycle around the menu and pick the picture mode you want. It wastes time and you could miss pictures.The video quality isn't so great and the microphone doesn't sound sterling.The Fuji photo software it comes with is pretty much useless.it is SO EASY to put your finger over the lens when using this. Other people using your camera will also do this, being less aware of it than you are.All in all, you will get compliments on the camera, it has nice features and lots of photo-modes, but at the end of the day, the pictures look less than perfect.\"\n\t\t\t\t[2701] StaticText 'Review by '\n\t\t\t\t[2703] StaticText 'romance loverromance lover'\n\t\t\t\t[2706] StaticText 'Posted on '\n\t\t\t\t[2707] time ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[2751] StaticText '4/20/23'\n\t\t\t\t[2708] StaticText 'Gorgeous pictures, high quality product'\n\t\t\t\t[2576] LayoutTable ''\n\t\t\t\t\t[2709] LayoutTableRow ''\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[2752] LayoutTableCell 'Rating'\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[2753] generic '100%'\n\t\t\t\t[2712] StaticText \"I have a Fuji S5200 which I couldn't be more pleased with but wanted a camera that I could slip into my pocket, keep in the car or throw into my computer bag on business trips.

I called Fuji and was told to send it in with the date and proof of purchase since it was a few days shy of the 1 year warranty. I just checked on the status of the camera and Fuji wants $50 to repair the cover and I was told by the customer rep that this was not covered under \"manufacturer\\'s warranty\". I asked her if that was not covered under the warranty than what was? She told me that only electrical components were covered. I argued with her that there is obviously some sort of manufacturer defect in the product since the lens cover just slid right off. I was basically told that there is a charge to fix the cover and that\\'s that. I asked her that if this same thing happened after I had only had the camera week, would Fuji still not honor the warranty and she said \"yes, I would still have to pay for it even if I had only had it for a week.\" What kind of customer service is this???? I asked to be forwarded to her supervisor and just shot off and email to him...let\\'s see what the response is....I will update later.
