I was totally upset and was on my way out of the shopping center where I saw the Xbox series X for sale. Decided to give it a chance.  Bought gamepass and everything was great since I could catch on with some titles I missed previously. But now, after about a year, I regret buying it. There is literally nothing to play. The amount of exclusives and AAA projects is so small that it\\'s just sad. There are some announcements like redfall (which I believe will be a fail), starfield(doubt it will be released any time soon). I just don\\'t believe in Microsoft anymore. Buying blizzard won\\'t change a thing since they are going downhill with their releases lately.\\nSo Am I the only one disappointed? Anyone feels the same?

Thank you for the feedback everyone!</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'m currently trying to decide if I should get an Xbox Series X or PS5. I currently own the Xbox One (original model) and I\\'ve never had a PS3 or 4. I\\'ve been interested in getting a PS5 as there are many exclusives from both PS4 and 5 that I want to play (FF7 Remake, Spider-Man, Ratchet and Clank, Project Diva Future Tone, to name a few)\\nAs for Xbox, there aren\\'t a lot of exclusives I really care about. Halo and Forza are cool but that\\'s all that interests me. The reason I\\'m also considering a Series X is because I do still own a good amount of Xbox games that I haven\\'t played or finished, and my Xbox One is in pretty rough shape. I\\'ve had it for nearly 7 years, and it\\'s a bit beat up. The console often has issues detecting any controller I use so I get controller disconnects frequently, and the console once had a roach problem. Of course, I can just play wired and the Xbox still works, but yeah it\\'s pretty old and beat up.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So basically, it\\'s either upgrade from my old and beat up Xbox One to the new Series X and keep playing my current games on a new and more powerful console, or switch to PS5 and experience a whole new library of games I\\'ve never gotten the chance to play. What do you guys think? I\\'ve been back and forth on which one I should get.</p>\\n]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124582</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124582\" />\\n    <title>Not a serious gamer buy considering an Xbox Series X \u2014 am I making a mistake?</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-24T07:05:18+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-24T07:05:18+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>bocologist</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/bocologist</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&lt;ugh, typo in heading which doesn\\'t seem editable ... but* considering...&gt;</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'m really more of a Nintendo person \u2014\\xa0I like short games, things like Mario Kart, Guitar Hero, Tetris, etc.  Things I can play with family and friends for a half hour here or there.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">However, I don\\'t love the Switch controller; I\\'m partial to a more typical controller shape.

I\\'ve scanned over and over through articles and old reddit posts, and I just cannot come to a decision that works for me. It may end up as a long read so I apologise for that, however any advice that anyone can offer would be hugely appreciated!</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'ve currently got both the XSX and the PS5. I initially started this generation with just the XSX, however towards the end of last year I also bought a PS5, although it\\'s currently being repaired by Sony under warranty due to a faulty fan.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Whilst it\\'s been in warranty though, it\\'s got me thinking that I do not want both consoles. I don\\'t have the time for both as I\\'m a young Dad, and I also don\\'t really have the money to be shelling out for games / subscriptions on both platforms. However I can\\'t decide which one is best for me though!</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'ll pre-empt this by saying I very, very rarely play with friends online, so following what console they\\'re on is not a problem for me.</p>\\n<p lang=\"fy\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'ll start with what I like about Xbox:</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Firstly, I love Bethesda RPGs. Skyrim is probably my favourite game of all time, and I also love the Fallout games too. Starfield and all future Bethesda games such as Elder Scrolls VI being exclusive to Xbox / Gamepass is a HUGE draw. I also love Forza, and I\\'m invested in the Gears of War and Halo games. Gamepass as a whole is fantastic too. The value is great, especially when you do the Xbox live conversion, and the fact that first party games are going to be available on the service on DAY ONE is another huge draw. Quick resume is awesome and I really like that. Another key point, I currently &quot;game share&quot; with a friend so we have access to eachothers games on the other\\'s console, so there\\'s a big cost saving there. For example, he\\'ll buy Fifa, I\\'ll buy CoD. He\\'ll buy Hogwarts Legacy, I\\'ll buy the new Jedi game, etc. Lastly, I feel like Microsoft is laying good foundations and is going to be the &quot;place to be&quot; for the future of gaming, firstly with the GamePass service, but also with Cloud Gaming (XCloud), and with potential future mergers with Activision for example. They\\'ve also got loads of new studios under their wing, so future first party exclusives could be around the corner.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So all in all, Xbox is a strong contender. However, what I love about PlayStation:</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Their current lineup of exclusives are all fantastic games. Although I will always pick say Starfield over the newest God Of War game, the fact that Sony offer SO many of these great games (TLOU, Horizon, God Of War, Spider-Man, etc) definitely makes it food for thought, especially with the current output of Bethesda games recently too (FO4 came out in 2015 was it? So an 8 year gap to Starfield, and who knows how long until ES VI). Xbox Exclusives in comparison over the last 10 years IMO have gone slightly downhill, especially with games such as Gears of War and Halo, however with all the new Xbox studios, once they\\'re up to speed, they could compete with some of these IPs. The PlayStation Plus service is okay; I know that they don\\'t offer day one first party games, but the lineup is good nevertheless. I love the controller and that truly does feel &quot;next-gen&quot;. I\\'m also under the impression that third party PS games perform better than Xbox games, especially on release anyway. The PS5 is also more popular, so I wonder if instead it\\'s safe to stick to PS for the future as oppose to this new future with Xbox. PlayStation games IMO are more expensive though, and you cannot use sites such as CD Keys to get games at a discounted rate.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So, there we have it. And here I am completely torn down the middle with what system to commit to. What I don\\'t want to happen is pick a platform to commit to and become ingrained in their eco-system, only to then change platforms and have to purchase all old games / hardware all over again.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Any advice would be great, especially from people who have maybe been in a similar position in the past and then decided to pick one platform over the other.</p>\\n]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124578</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124578\" />\\n    <title>Would you buy a Nintendo GameCube Classic edition</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-21T23:53:48+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-21T23:53:48+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Lightincable</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/Lightincable</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124577</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124577\" />\\n    <title>Name A better console you Can\u2019t</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-21T19:19:32+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-21T19:19:32+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Lightincable</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/Lightincable</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124576</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124576\" />\\n    <title>How trustfull would you say Michael Pachter is?</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-21T12:52:16+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-21T12:52:16+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>GamerTMTDK</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/GamerTMTDK</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hi.

I was totally upset and was on my way out of the shopping center where I saw the Xbox series X for sale. Decided to give it a chance.  Bought gamepass and everything was great since I could catch on with some titles I missed previously. But now, after about a year, I regret buying it. There is literally nothing to play. The amount of exclusives and AAA projects is so small that it\\'s just sad. There are some announcements like redfall (which I believe will be a fail), starfield(doubt it will be released any time soon). I just don\\'t believe in Microsoft anymore. Buying blizzard won\\'t change a thing since they are going downhill with their releases lately.\\nSo Am I the only one disappointed? Anyone feels the same?

Thank you for the feedback everyone!</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'m currently trying to decide if I should get an Xbox Series X or PS5. I currently own the Xbox One (original model) and I\\'ve never had a PS3 or 4. I\\'ve been interested in getting a PS5 as there are many exclusives from both PS4 and 5 that I want to play (FF7 Remake, Spider-Man, Ratchet and Clank, Project Diva Future Tone, to name a few)\\nAs for Xbox, there aren\\'t a lot of exclusives I really care about. Halo and Forza are cool but that\\'s all that interests me. The reason I\\'m also considering a Series X is because I do still own a good amount of Xbox games that I haven\\'t played or finished, and my Xbox One is in pretty rough shape. I\\'ve had it for nearly 7 years, and it\\'s a bit beat up. The console often has issues detecting any controller I use so I get controller disconnects frequently, and the console once had a roach problem. Of course, I can just play wired and the Xbox still works, but yeah it\\'s pretty old and beat up.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So basically, it\\'s either upgrade from my old and beat up Xbox One to the new Series X and keep playing my current games on a new and more powerful console, or switch to PS5 and experience a whole new library of games I\\'ve never gotten the chance to play. What do you guys think? I\\'ve been back and forth on which one I should get.</p>\\n]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124582</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124582\" />\\n    <title>Not a serious gamer buy considering an Xbox Series X \u2014 am I making a mistake?</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-24T07:05:18+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-24T07:05:18+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>bocologist</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/bocologist</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&lt;ugh, typo in heading which doesn\\'t seem editable ... but* considering...&gt;</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'m really more of a Nintendo person \u2014\\xa0I like short games, things like Mario Kart, Guitar Hero, Tetris, etc.  Things I can play with family and friends for a half hour here or there.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">However, I don\\'t love the Switch controller; I\\'m partial to a more typical controller shape.

I\\'ve scanned over and over through articles and old reddit posts, and I just cannot come to a decision that works for me. It may end up as a long read so I apologise for that, however any advice that anyone can offer would be hugely appreciated!</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'ve currently got both the XSX and the PS5. I initially started this generation with just the XSX, however towards the end of last year I also bought a PS5, although it\\'s currently being repaired by Sony under warranty due to a faulty fan.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Whilst it\\'s been in warranty though, it\\'s got me thinking that I do not want both consoles. I don\\'t have the time for both as I\\'m a young Dad, and I also don\\'t really have the money to be shelling out for games / subscriptions on both platforms. However I can\\'t decide which one is best for me though!</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'ll pre-empt this by saying I very, very rarely play with friends online, so following what console they\\'re on is not a problem for me.</p>\\n<p lang=\"fy\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'ll start with what I like about Xbox:</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Firstly, I love Bethesda RPGs. Skyrim is probably my favourite game of all time, and I also love the Fallout games too. Starfield and all future Bethesda games such as Elder Scrolls VI being exclusive to Xbox / Gamepass is a HUGE draw. I also love Forza, and I\\'m invested in the Gears of War and Halo games. Gamepass as a whole is fantastic too. The value is great, especially when you do the Xbox live conversion, and the fact that first party games are going to be available on the service on DAY ONE is another huge draw. Quick resume is awesome and I really like that. Another key point, I currently &quot;game share&quot; with a friend so we have access to eachothers games on the other\\'s console, so there\\'s a big cost saving there. For example, he\\'ll buy Fifa, I\\'ll buy CoD. He\\'ll buy Hogwarts Legacy, I\\'ll buy the new Jedi game, etc. Lastly, I feel like Microsoft is laying good foundations and is going to be the &quot;place to be&quot; for the future of gaming, firstly with the GamePass service, but also with Cloud Gaming (XCloud), and with potential future mergers with Activision for example. They\\'ve also got loads of new studios under their wing, so future first party exclusives could be around the corner.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So all in all, Xbox is a strong contender. However, what I love about PlayStation:</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Their current lineup of exclusives are all fantastic games. Although I will always pick say Starfield over the newest God Of War game, the fact that Sony offer SO many of these great games (TLOU, Horizon, God Of War, Spider-Man, etc) definitely makes it food for thought, especially with the current output of Bethesda games recently too (FO4 came out in 2015 was it? So an 8 year gap to Starfield, and who knows how long until ES VI). Xbox Exclusives in comparison over the last 10 years IMO have gone slightly downhill, especially with games such as Gears of War and Halo, however with all the new Xbox studios, once they\\'re up to speed, they could compete with some of these IPs. The PlayStation Plus service is okay; I know that they don\\'t offer day one first party games, but the lineup is good nevertheless. I love the controller and that truly does feel &quot;next-gen&quot;. I\\'m also under the impression that third party PS games perform better than Xbox games, especially on release anyway. The PS5 is also more popular, so I wonder if instead it\\'s safe to stick to PS for the future as oppose to this new future with Xbox. PlayStation games IMO are more expensive though, and you cannot use sites such as CD Keys to get games at a discounted rate.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So, there we have it. And here I am completely torn down the middle with what system to commit to. What I don\\'t want to happen is pick a platform to commit to and become ingrained in their eco-system, only to then change platforms and have to purchase all old games / hardware all over again.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Any advice would be great, especially from people who have maybe been in a similar position in the past and then decided to pick one platform over the other.</p>\\n]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124578</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124578\" />\\n    <title>Would you buy a Nintendo GameCube Classic edition</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-21T23:53:48+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-21T23:53:48+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Lightincable</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/Lightincable</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124577</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124577\" />\\n    <title>Name A better console you Can\u2019t</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-21T19:19:32+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-21T19:19:32+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Lightincable</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/Lightincable</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124576</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124576\" />\\n    <title>How trustfull would you say Michael Pachter is?</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-21T12:52:16+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-21T12:52:16+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>GamerTMTDK</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/GamerTMTDK</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hi.

I was totally upset and was on my way out of the shopping center where I saw the Xbox series X for sale. Decided to give it a chance.  Bought gamepass and everything was great since I could catch on with some titles I missed previously. But now, after about a year, I regret buying it. There is literally nothing to play. The amount of exclusives and AAA projects is so small that it\\'s just sad. There are some announcements like redfall (which I believe will be a fail), starfield(doubt it will be released any time soon). I just don\\'t believe in Microsoft anymore. Buying blizzard won\\'t change a thing since they are going downhill with their releases lately.\\nSo Am I the only one disappointed? Anyone feels the same?

Thank you for the feedback everyone!</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'m currently trying to decide if I should get an Xbox Series X or PS5. I currently own the Xbox One (original model) and I\\'ve never had a PS3 or 4. I\\'ve been interested in getting a PS5 as there are many exclusives from both PS4 and 5 that I want to play (FF7 Remake, Spider-Man, Ratchet and Clank, Project Diva Future Tone, to name a few)\\nAs for Xbox, there aren\\'t a lot of exclusives I really care about. Halo and Forza are cool but that\\'s all that interests me. The reason I\\'m also considering a Series X is because I do still own a good amount of Xbox games that I haven\\'t played or finished, and my Xbox One is in pretty rough shape. I\\'ve had it for nearly 7 years, and it\\'s a bit beat up. The console often has issues detecting any controller I use so I get controller disconnects frequently, and the console once had a roach problem. Of course, I can just play wired and the Xbox still works, but yeah it\\'s pretty old and beat up.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So basically, it\\'s either upgrade from my old and beat up Xbox One to the new Series X and keep playing my current games on a new and more powerful console, or switch to PS5 and experience a whole new library of games I\\'ve never gotten the chance to play. What do you guys think? I\\'ve been back and forth on which one I should get.</p>\\n]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124582</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124582\" />\\n    <title>Not a serious gamer buy considering an Xbox Series X \u2014 am I making a mistake?</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-24T07:05:18+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-24T07:05:18+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>bocologist</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/bocologist</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&lt;ugh, typo in heading which doesn\\'t seem editable ... but* considering...&gt;</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'m really more of a Nintendo person \u2014\\xa0I like short games, things like Mario Kart, Guitar Hero, Tetris, etc.  Things I can play with family and friends for a half hour here or there.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">However, I don\\'t love the Switch controller; I\\'m partial to a more typical controller shape.

I\\'ve scanned over and over through articles and old reddit posts, and I just cannot come to a decision that works for me. It may end up as a long read so I apologise for that, however any advice that anyone can offer would be hugely appreciated!</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'ve currently got both the XSX and the PS5. I initially started this generation with just the XSX, however towards the end of last year I also bought a PS5, although it\\'s currently being repaired by Sony under warranty due to a faulty fan.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Whilst it\\'s been in warranty though, it\\'s got me thinking that I do not want both consoles. I don\\'t have the time for both as I\\'m a young Dad, and I also don\\'t really have the money to be shelling out for games / subscriptions on both platforms. However I can\\'t decide which one is best for me though!</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'ll pre-empt this by saying I very, very rarely play with friends online, so following what console they\\'re on is not a problem for me.</p>\\n<p lang=\"fy\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'ll start with what I like about Xbox:</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Firstly, I love Bethesda RPGs. Skyrim is probably my favourite game of all time, and I also love the Fallout games too. Starfield and all future Bethesda games such as Elder Scrolls VI being exclusive to Xbox / Gamepass is a HUGE draw. I also love Forza, and I\\'m invested in the Gears of War and Halo games. Gamepass as a whole is fantastic too. The value is great, especially when you do the Xbox live conversion, and the fact that first party games are going to be available on the service on DAY ONE is another huge draw. Quick resume is awesome and I really like that. Another key point, I currently &quot;game share&quot; with a friend so we have access to eachothers games on the other\\'s console, so there\\'s a big cost saving there. For example, he\\'ll buy Fifa, I\\'ll buy CoD. He\\'ll buy Hogwarts Legacy, I\\'ll buy the new Jedi game, etc. Lastly, I feel like Microsoft is laying good foundations and is going to be the &quot;place to be&quot; for the future of gaming, firstly with the GamePass service, but also with Cloud Gaming (XCloud), and with potential future mergers with Activision for example. They\\'ve also got loads of new studios under their wing, so future first party exclusives could be around the corner.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So all in all, Xbox is a strong contender. However, what I love about PlayStation:</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Their current lineup of exclusives are all fantastic games. Although I will always pick say Starfield over the newest God Of War game, the fact that Sony offer SO many of these great games (TLOU, Horizon, God Of War, Spider-Man, etc) definitely makes it food for thought, especially with the current output of Bethesda games recently too (FO4 came out in 2015 was it? So an 8 year gap to Starfield, and who knows how long until ES VI). Xbox Exclusives in comparison over the last 10 years IMO have gone slightly downhill, especially with games such as Gears of War and Halo, however with all the new Xbox studios, once they\\'re up to speed, they could compete with some of these IPs. The PlayStation Plus service is okay; I know that they don\\'t offer day one first party games, but the lineup is good nevertheless. I love the controller and that truly does feel &quot;next-gen&quot;. I\\'m also under the impression that third party PS games perform better than Xbox games, especially on release anyway. The PS5 is also more popular, so I wonder if instead it\\'s safe to stick to PS for the future as oppose to this new future with Xbox. PlayStation games IMO are more expensive though, and you cannot use sites such as CD Keys to get games at a discounted rate.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So, there we have it. And here I am completely torn down the middle with what system to commit to. What I don\\'t want to happen is pick a platform to commit to and become ingrained in their eco-system, only to then change platforms and have to purchase all old games / hardware all over again.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Any advice would be great, especially from people who have maybe been in a similar position in the past and then decided to pick one platform over the other.</p>\\n]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124578</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124578\" />\\n    <title>Would you buy a Nintendo GameCube Classic edition</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-21T23:53:48+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-21T23:53:48+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Lightincable</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/Lightincable</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124577</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124577\" />\\n    <title>Name A better console you Can\u2019t</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-21T19:19:32+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-21T19:19:32+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Lightincable</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/Lightincable</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124576</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124576\" />\\n    <title>How trustfull would you say Michael Pachter is?</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-21T12:52:16+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-21T12:52:16+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>GamerTMTDK</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/GamerTMTDK</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hi.

I\\'m not sure that it will include DLSS technology because it would be an added cost.

I was totally upset and was on my way out of the shopping center where I saw the Xbox series X for sale. Decided to give it a chance.  Bought gamepass and everything was great since I could catch on with some titles I missed previously. But now, after about a year, I regret buying it. There is literally nothing to play. The amount of exclusives and AAA projects is so small that it\\'s just sad. There are some announcements like redfall (which I believe will be a fail), starfield(doubt it will be released any time soon). I just don\\'t believe in Microsoft anymore. Buying blizzard won\\'t change a thing since they are going downhill with their releases lately.\\nSo Am I the only one disappointed? Anyone feels the same?

Thank you for the feedback everyone!</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'m currently trying to decide if I should get an Xbox Series X or PS5. I currently own the Xbox One (original model) and I\\'ve never had a PS3 or 4. I\\'ve been interested in getting a PS5 as there are many exclusives from both PS4 and 5 that I want to play (FF7 Remake, Spider-Man, Ratchet and Clank, Project Diva Future Tone, to name a few)\\nAs for Xbox, there aren\\'t a lot of exclusives I really care about. Halo and Forza are cool but that\\'s all that interests me. The reason I\\'m also considering a Series X is because I do still own a good amount of Xbox games that I haven\\'t played or finished, and my Xbox One is in pretty rough shape. I\\'ve had it for nearly 7 years, and it\\'s a bit beat up. The console often has issues detecting any controller I use so I get controller disconnects frequently, and the console once had a roach problem. Of course, I can just play wired and the Xbox still works, but yeah it\\'s pretty old and beat up.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So basically, it\\'s either upgrade from my old and beat up Xbox One to the new Series X and keep playing my current games on a new and more powerful console, or switch to PS5 and experience a whole new library of games I\\'ve never gotten the chance to play. What do you guys think? I\\'ve been back and forth on which one I should get.</p>\\n]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124582</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124582\" />\\n    <title>Not a serious gamer buy considering an Xbox Series X \u2014 am I making a mistake?</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-24T07:05:18+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-24T07:05:18+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>bocologist</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/bocologist</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&lt;ugh, typo in heading which doesn\\'t seem editable ... but* considering...&gt;</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'m really more of a Nintendo person \u2014\\xa0I like short games, things like Mario Kart, Guitar Hero, Tetris, etc.  Things I can play with family and friends for a half hour here or there.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">However, I don\\'t love the Switch controller; I\\'m partial to a more typical controller shape.

I\\'ve scanned over and over through articles and old reddit posts, and I just cannot come to a decision that works for me. It may end up as a long read so I apologise for that, however any advice that anyone can offer would be hugely appreciated!</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'ve currently got both the XSX and the PS5. I initially started this generation with just the XSX, however towards the end of last year I also bought a PS5, although it\\'s currently being repaired by Sony under warranty due to a faulty fan.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Whilst it\\'s been in warranty though, it\\'s got me thinking that I do not want both consoles. I don\\'t have the time for both as I\\'m a young Dad, and I also don\\'t really have the money to be shelling out for games / subscriptions on both platforms. However I can\\'t decide which one is best for me though!</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'ll pre-empt this by saying I very, very rarely play with friends online, so following what console they\\'re on is not a problem for me.</p>\\n<p lang=\"fy\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'ll start with what I like about Xbox:</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Firstly, I love Bethesda RPGs. Skyrim is probably my favourite game of all time, and I also love the Fallout games too. Starfield and all future Bethesda games such as Elder Scrolls VI being exclusive to Xbox / Gamepass is a HUGE draw. I also love Forza, and I\\'m invested in the Gears of War and Halo games. Gamepass as a whole is fantastic too. The value is great, especially when you do the Xbox live conversion, and the fact that first party games are going to be available on the service on DAY ONE is another huge draw. Quick resume is awesome and I really like that. Another key point, I currently &quot;game share&quot; with a friend so we have access to eachothers games on the other\\'s console, so there\\'s a big cost saving there. For example, he\\'ll buy Fifa, I\\'ll buy CoD. He\\'ll buy Hogwarts Legacy, I\\'ll buy the new Jedi game, etc. Lastly, I feel like Microsoft is laying good foundations and is going to be the &quot;place to be&quot; for the future of gaming, firstly with the GamePass service, but also with Cloud Gaming (XCloud), and with potential future mergers with Activision for example. They\\'ve also got loads of new studios under their wing, so future first party exclusives could be around the corner.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So all in all, Xbox is a strong contender. However, what I love about PlayStation:</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Their current lineup of exclusives are all fantastic games. Although I will always pick say Starfield over the newest God Of War game, the fact that Sony offer SO many of these great games (TLOU, Horizon, God Of War, Spider-Man, etc) definitely makes it food for thought, especially with the current output of Bethesda games recently too (FO4 came out in 2015 was it? So an 8 year gap to Starfield, and who knows how long until ES VI). Xbox Exclusives in comparison over the last 10 years IMO have gone slightly downhill, especially with games such as Gears of War and Halo, however with all the new Xbox studios, once they\\'re up to speed, they could compete with some of these IPs. The PlayStation Plus service is okay; I know that they don\\'t offer day one first party games, but the lineup is good nevertheless. I love the controller and that truly does feel &quot;next-gen&quot;. I\\'m also under the impression that third party PS games perform better than Xbox games, especially on release anyway. The PS5 is also more popular, so I wonder if instead it\\'s safe to stick to PS for the future as oppose to this new future with Xbox. PlayStation games IMO are more expensive though, and you cannot use sites such as CD Keys to get games at a discounted rate.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So, there we have it. And here I am completely torn down the middle with what system to commit to. What I don\\'t want to happen is pick a platform to commit to and become ingrained in their eco-system, only to then change platforms and have to purchase all old games / hardware all over again.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Any advice would be great, especially from people who have maybe been in a similar position in the past and then decided to pick one platform over the other.</p>\\n]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124578</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124578\" />\\n    <title>Would you buy a Nintendo GameCube Classic edition</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-21T23:53:48+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-21T23:53:48+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Lightincable</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/Lightincable</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124577</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124577\" />\\n    <title>Name A better console you Can\u2019t</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-21T19:19:32+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-21T19:19:32+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Lightincable</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/Lightincable</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124576</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124576\" />\\n    <title>How trustfull would you say Michael Pachter is?</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-21T12:52:16+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-21T12:52:16+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>GamerTMTDK</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/GamerTMTDK</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hi.

I was totally upset and was on my way out of the shopping center where I saw the Xbox series X for sale. Decided to give it a chance.  Bought gamepass and everything was great since I could catch on with some titles I missed previously. But now, after about a year, I regret buying it. There is literally nothing to play. The amount of exclusives and AAA projects is so small that it\\'s just sad. There are some announcements like redfall (which I believe will be a fail), starfield(doubt it will be released any time soon). I just don\\'t believe in Microsoft anymore. Buying blizzard won\\'t change a thing since they are going downhill with their releases lately.\\nSo Am I the only one disappointed? Anyone feels the same?

Thank you for the feedback everyone!</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'m currently trying to decide if I should get an Xbox Series X or PS5. I currently own the Xbox One (original model) and I\\'ve never had a PS3 or 4. I\\'ve been interested in getting a PS5 as there are many exclusives from both PS4 and 5 that I want to play (FF7 Remake, Spider-Man, Ratchet and Clank, Project Diva Future Tone, to name a few)\\nAs for Xbox, there aren\\'t a lot of exclusives I really care about. Halo and Forza are cool but that\\'s all that interests me. The reason I\\'m also considering a Series X is because I do still own a good amount of Xbox games that I haven\\'t played or finished, and my Xbox One is in pretty rough shape. I\\'ve had it for nearly 7 years, and it\\'s a bit beat up. The console often has issues detecting any controller I use so I get controller disconnects frequently, and the console once had a roach problem. Of course, I can just play wired and the Xbox still works, but yeah it\\'s pretty old and beat up.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So basically, it\\'s either upgrade from my old and beat up Xbox One to the new Series X and keep playing my current games on a new and more powerful console, or switch to PS5 and experience a whole new library of games I\\'ve never gotten the chance to play. What do you guys think? I\\'ve been back and forth on which one I should get.</p>\\n]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124582</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124582\" />\\n    <title>Not a serious gamer buy considering an Xbox Series X \u2014 am I making a mistake?</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-24T07:05:18+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-24T07:05:18+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>bocologist</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/bocologist</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&lt;ugh, typo in heading which doesn\\'t seem editable ... but* considering...&gt;</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'m really more of a Nintendo person \u2014\\xa0I like short games, things like Mario Kart, Guitar Hero, Tetris, etc.  Things I can play with family and friends for a half hour here or there.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">However, I don\\'t love the Switch controller; I\\'m partial to a more typical controller shape.

I\\'ve scanned over and over through articles and old reddit posts, and I just cannot come to a decision that works for me. It may end up as a long read so I apologise for that, however any advice that anyone can offer would be hugely appreciated!</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'ve currently got both the XSX and the PS5. I initially started this generation with just the XSX, however towards the end of last year I also bought a PS5, although it\\'s currently being repaired by Sony under warranty due to a faulty fan.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Whilst it\\'s been in warranty though, it\\'s got me thinking that I do not want both consoles. I don\\'t have the time for both as I\\'m a young Dad, and I also don\\'t really have the money to be shelling out for games / subscriptions on both platforms. However I can\\'t decide which one is best for me though!</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'ll pre-empt this by saying I very, very rarely play with friends online, so following what console they\\'re on is not a problem for me.</p>\\n<p lang=\"fy\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'ll start with what I like about Xbox:</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Firstly, I love Bethesda RPGs. Skyrim is probably my favourite game of all time, and I also love the Fallout games too. Starfield and all future Bethesda games such as Elder Scrolls VI being exclusive to Xbox / Gamepass is a HUGE draw. I also love Forza, and I\\'m invested in the Gears of War and Halo games. Gamepass as a whole is fantastic too. The value is great, especially when you do the Xbox live conversion, and the fact that first party games are going to be available on the service on DAY ONE is another huge draw. Quick resume is awesome and I really like that. Another key point, I currently &quot;game share&quot; with a friend so we have access to eachothers games on the other\\'s console, so there\\'s a big cost saving there. For example, he\\'ll buy Fifa, I\\'ll buy CoD. He\\'ll buy Hogwarts Legacy, I\\'ll buy the new Jedi game, etc. Lastly, I feel like Microsoft is laying good foundations and is going to be the &quot;place to be&quot; for the future of gaming, firstly with the GamePass service, but also with Cloud Gaming (XCloud), and with potential future mergers with Activision for example. They\\'ve also got loads of new studios under their wing, so future first party exclusives could be around the corner.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So all in all, Xbox is a strong contender. However, what I love about PlayStation:</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Their current lineup of exclusives are all fantastic games. Although I will always pick say Starfield over the newest God Of War game, the fact that Sony offer SO many of these great games (TLOU, Horizon, God Of War, Spider-Man, etc) definitely makes it food for thought, especially with the current output of Bethesda games recently too (FO4 came out in 2015 was it? So an 8 year gap to Starfield, and who knows how long until ES VI). Xbox Exclusives in comparison over the last 10 years IMO have gone slightly downhill, especially with games such as Gears of War and Halo, however with all the new Xbox studios, once they\\'re up to speed, they could compete with some of these IPs. The PlayStation Plus service is okay; I know that they don\\'t offer day one first party games, but the lineup is good nevertheless. I love the controller and that truly does feel &quot;next-gen&quot;. I\\'m also under the impression that third party PS games perform better than Xbox games, especially on release anyway. The PS5 is also more popular, so I wonder if instead it\\'s safe to stick to PS for the future as oppose to this new future with Xbox. PlayStation games IMO are more expensive though, and you cannot use sites such as CD Keys to get games at a discounted rate.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So, there we have it. And here I am completely torn down the middle with what system to commit to. What I don\\'t want to happen is pick a platform to commit to and become ingrained in their eco-system, only to then change platforms and have to purchase all old games / hardware all over again.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Any advice would be great, especially from people who have maybe been in a similar position in the past and then decided to pick one platform over the other.</p>\\n]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124578</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124578\" />\\n    <title>Would you buy a Nintendo GameCube Classic edition</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-21T23:53:48+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-21T23:53:48+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Lightincable</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/Lightincable</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124577</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124577\" />\\n    <title>Name A better console you Can\u2019t</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-21T19:19:32+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-21T19:19:32+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Lightincable</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/Lightincable</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124576</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124576\" />\\n    <title>How trustfull would you say Michael Pachter is?</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-21T12:52:16+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-21T12:52:16+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>GamerTMTDK</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/GamerTMTDK</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hi.

I\\'m not sure that it will include DLSS technology because it would be an added cost.

I was totally upset and was on my way out of the shopping center where I saw the Xbox series X for sale. Decided to give it a chance.  Bought gamepass and everything was great since I could catch on with some titles I missed previously. But now, after about a year, I regret buying it. There is literally nothing to play. The amount of exclusives and AAA projects is so small that it\\'s just sad. There are some announcements like redfall (which I believe will be a fail), starfield(doubt it will be released any time soon). I just don\\'t believe in Microsoft anymore. Buying blizzard won\\'t change a thing since they are going downhill with their releases lately.\\nSo Am I the only one disappointed? Anyone feels the same?

Thank you for the feedback everyone!</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'m currently trying to decide if I should get an Xbox Series X or PS5. I currently own the Xbox One (original model) and I\\'ve never had a PS3 or 4. I\\'ve been interested in getting a PS5 as there are many exclusives from both PS4 and 5 that I want to play (FF7 Remake, Spider-Man, Ratchet and Clank, Project Diva Future Tone, to name a few)\\nAs for Xbox, there aren\\'t a lot of exclusives I really care about. Halo and Forza are cool but that\\'s all that interests me. The reason I\\'m also considering a Series X is because I do still own a good amount of Xbox games that I haven\\'t played or finished, and my Xbox One is in pretty rough shape. I\\'ve had it for nearly 7 years, and it\\'s a bit beat up. The console often has issues detecting any controller I use so I get controller disconnects frequently, and the console once had a roach problem. Of course, I can just play wired and the Xbox still works, but yeah it\\'s pretty old and beat up.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So basically, it\\'s either upgrade from my old and beat up Xbox One to the new Series X and keep playing my current games on a new and more powerful console, or switch to PS5 and experience a whole new library of games I\\'ve never gotten the chance to play. What do you guys think? I\\'ve been back and forth on which one I should get.</p>\\n]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124582</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124582\" />\\n    <title>Not a serious gamer buy considering an Xbox Series X \u2014 am I making a mistake?</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-24T07:05:18+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-24T07:05:18+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>bocologist</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/bocologist</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&lt;ugh, typo in heading which doesn\\'t seem editable ... but* considering...&gt;</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'m really more of a Nintendo person \u2014\\xa0I like short games, things like Mario Kart, Guitar Hero, Tetris, etc.  Things I can play with family and friends for a half hour here or there.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">However, I don\\'t love the Switch controller; I\\'m partial to a more typical controller shape.

I\\'ve scanned over and over through articles and old reddit posts, and I just cannot come to a decision that works for me. It may end up as a long read so I apologise for that, however any advice that anyone can offer would be hugely appreciated!</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'ve currently got both the XSX and the PS5. I initially started this generation with just the XSX, however towards the end of last year I also bought a PS5, although it\\'s currently being repaired by Sony under warranty due to a faulty fan.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Whilst it\\'s been in warranty though, it\\'s got me thinking that I do not want both consoles. I don\\'t have the time for both as I\\'m a young Dad, and I also don\\'t really have the money to be shelling out for games / subscriptions on both platforms. However I can\\'t decide which one is best for me though!</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'ll pre-empt this by saying I very, very rarely play with friends online, so following what console they\\'re on is not a problem for me.</p>\\n<p lang=\"fy\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'ll start with what I like about Xbox:</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Firstly, I love Bethesda RPGs. Skyrim is probably my favourite game of all time, and I also love the Fallout games too. Starfield and all future Bethesda games such as Elder Scrolls VI being exclusive to Xbox / Gamepass is a HUGE draw. I also love Forza, and I\\'m invested in the Gears of War and Halo games. Gamepass as a whole is fantastic too. The value is great, especially when you do the Xbox live conversion, and the fact that first party games are going to be available on the service on DAY ONE is another huge draw. Quick resume is awesome and I really like that. Another key point, I currently &quot;game share&quot; with a friend so we have access to eachothers games on the other\\'s console, so there\\'s a big cost saving there. For example, he\\'ll buy Fifa, I\\'ll buy CoD. He\\'ll buy Hogwarts Legacy, I\\'ll buy the new Jedi game, etc. Lastly, I feel like Microsoft is laying good foundations and is going to be the &quot;place to be&quot; for the future of gaming, firstly with the GamePass service, but also with Cloud Gaming (XCloud), and with potential future mergers with Activision for example. They\\'ve also got loads of new studios under their wing, so future first party exclusives could be around the corner.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So all in all, Xbox is a strong contender. However, what I love about PlayStation:</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Their current lineup of exclusives are all fantastic games. Although I will always pick say Starfield over the newest God Of War game, the fact that Sony offer SO many of these great games (TLOU, Horizon, God Of War, Spider-Man, etc) definitely makes it food for thought, especially with the current output of Bethesda games recently too (FO4 came out in 2015 was it? So an 8 year gap to Starfield, and who knows how long until ES VI). Xbox Exclusives in comparison over the last 10 years IMO have gone slightly downhill, especially with games such as Gears of War and Halo, however with all the new Xbox studios, once they\\'re up to speed, they could compete with some of these IPs. The PlayStation Plus service is okay; I know that they don\\'t offer day one first party games, but the lineup is good nevertheless. I love the controller and that truly does feel &quot;next-gen&quot;. I\\'m also under the impression that third party PS games perform better than Xbox games, especially on release anyway. The PS5 is also more popular, so I wonder if instead it\\'s safe to stick to PS for the future as oppose to this new future with Xbox. PlayStation games IMO are more expensive though, and you cannot use sites such as CD Keys to get games at a discounted rate.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So, there we have it. And here I am completely torn down the middle with what system to commit to. What I don\\'t want to happen is pick a platform to commit to and become ingrained in their eco-system, only to then change platforms and have to purchase all old games / hardware all over again.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Any advice would be great, especially from people who have maybe been in a similar position in the past and then decided to pick one platform over the other.</p>\\n]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124578</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124578\" />\\n    <title>Would you buy a Nintendo GameCube Classic edition</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-21T23:53:48+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-21T23:53:48+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Lightincable</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/Lightincable</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124577</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124577\" />\\n    <title>Name A better console you Can\u2019t</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-21T19:19:32+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-21T19:19:32+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Lightincable</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/Lightincable</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124576</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124576\" />\\n    <title>How trustfull would you say Michael Pachter is?</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-21T12:52:16+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-21T12:52:16+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>GamerTMTDK</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/GamerTMTDK</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hi.

I was totally upset and was on my way out of the shopping center where I saw the Xbox series X for sale. Decided to give it a chance.  Bought gamepass and everything was great since I could catch on with some titles I missed previously. But now, after about a year, I regret buying it. There is literally nothing to play. The amount of exclusives and AAA projects is so small that it\\'s just sad. There are some announcements like redfall (which I believe will be a fail), starfield(doubt it will be released any time soon). I just don\\'t believe in Microsoft anymore. Buying blizzard won\\'t change a thing since they are going downhill with their releases lately.\\nSo Am I the only one disappointed? Anyone feels the same?

Thank you for the feedback everyone!</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'m currently trying to decide if I should get an Xbox Series X or PS5. I currently own the Xbox One (original model) and I\\'ve never had a PS3 or 4. I\\'ve been interested in getting a PS5 as there are many exclusives from both PS4 and 5 that I want to play (FF7 Remake, Spider-Man, Ratchet and Clank, Project Diva Future Tone, to name a few)\\nAs for Xbox, there aren\\'t a lot of exclusives I really care about. Halo and Forza are cool but that\\'s all that interests me. The reason I\\'m also considering a Series X is because I do still own a good amount of Xbox games that I haven\\'t played or finished, and my Xbox One is in pretty rough shape. I\\'ve had it for nearly 7 years, and it\\'s a bit beat up. The console often has issues detecting any controller I use so I get controller disconnects frequently, and the console once had a roach problem. Of course, I can just play wired and the Xbox still works, but yeah it\\'s pretty old and beat up.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So basically, it\\'s either upgrade from my old and beat up Xbox One to the new Series X and keep playing my current games on a new and more powerful console, or switch to PS5 and experience a whole new library of games I\\'ve never gotten the chance to play. What do you guys think? I\\'ve been back and forth on which one I should get.</p>\\n]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124582</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124582\" />\\n    <title>Not a serious gamer buy considering an Xbox Series X \u2014 am I making a mistake?</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-24T07:05:18+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-24T07:05:18+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>bocologist</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/bocologist</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&lt;ugh, typo in heading which doesn\\'t seem editable ... but* considering...&gt;</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'m really more of a Nintendo person \u2014\\xa0I like short games, things like Mario Kart, Guitar Hero, Tetris, etc.  Things I can play with family and friends for a half hour here or there.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">However, I don\\'t love the Switch controller; I\\'m partial to a more typical controller shape.

I\\'ve scanned over and over through articles and old reddit posts, and I just cannot come to a decision that works for me. It may end up as a long read so I apologise for that, however any advice that anyone can offer would be hugely appreciated!</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'ve currently got both the XSX and the PS5. I initially started this generation with just the XSX, however towards the end of last year I also bought a PS5, although it\\'s currently being repaired by Sony under warranty due to a faulty fan.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Whilst it\\'s been in warranty though, it\\'s got me thinking that I do not want both consoles. I don\\'t have the time for both as I\\'m a young Dad, and I also don\\'t really have the money to be shelling out for games / subscriptions on both platforms. However I can\\'t decide which one is best for me though!</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'ll pre-empt this by saying I very, very rarely play with friends online, so following what console they\\'re on is not a problem for me.</p>\\n<p lang=\"fy\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'ll start with what I like about Xbox:</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Firstly, I love Bethesda RPGs. Skyrim is probably my favourite game of all time, and I also love the Fallout games too. Starfield and all future Bethesda games such as Elder Scrolls VI being exclusive to Xbox / Gamepass is a HUGE draw. I also love Forza, and I\\'m invested in the Gears of War and Halo games. Gamepass as a whole is fantastic too. The value is great, especially when you do the Xbox live conversion, and the fact that first party games are going to be available on the service on DAY ONE is another huge draw. Quick resume is awesome and I really like that. Another key point, I currently &quot;game share&quot; with a friend so we have access to eachothers games on the other\\'s console, so there\\'s a big cost saving there. For example, he\\'ll buy Fifa, I\\'ll buy CoD. He\\'ll buy Hogwarts Legacy, I\\'ll buy the new Jedi game, etc. Lastly, I feel like Microsoft is laying good foundations and is going to be the &quot;place to be&quot; for the future of gaming, firstly with the GamePass service, but also with Cloud Gaming (XCloud), and with potential future mergers with Activision for example. They\\'ve also got loads of new studios under their wing, so future first party exclusives could be around the corner.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So all in all, Xbox is a strong contender. However, what I love about PlayStation:</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Their current lineup of exclusives are all fantastic games. Although I will always pick say Starfield over the newest God Of War game, the fact that Sony offer SO many of these great games (TLOU, Horizon, God Of War, Spider-Man, etc) definitely makes it food for thought, especially with the current output of Bethesda games recently too (FO4 came out in 2015 was it? So an 8 year gap to Starfield, and who knows how long until ES VI). Xbox Exclusives in comparison over the last 10 years IMO have gone slightly downhill, especially with games such as Gears of War and Halo, however with all the new Xbox studios, once they\\'re up to speed, they could compete with some of these IPs. The PlayStation Plus service is okay; I know that they don\\'t offer day one first party games, but the lineup is good nevertheless. I love the controller and that truly does feel &quot;next-gen&quot;. I\\'m also under the impression that third party PS games perform better than Xbox games, especially on release anyway. The PS5 is also more popular, so I wonder if instead it\\'s safe to stick to PS for the future as oppose to this new future with Xbox. PlayStation games IMO are more expensive though, and you cannot use sites such as CD Keys to get games at a discounted rate.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So, there we have it. And here I am completely torn down the middle with what system to commit to. What I don\\'t want to happen is pick a platform to commit to and become ingrained in their eco-system, only to then change platforms and have to purchase all old games / hardware all over again.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Any advice would be great, especially from people who have maybe been in a similar position in the past and then decided to pick one platform over the other.</p>\\n]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124578</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124578\" />\\n    <title>Would you buy a Nintendo GameCube Classic edition</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-21T23:53:48+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-21T23:53:48+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Lightincable</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/Lightincable</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124577</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124577\" />\\n    <title>Name A better console you Can\u2019t</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-21T19:19:32+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-21T19:19:32+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Lightincable</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/Lightincable</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124576</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124576\" />\\n    <title>How trustfull would you say Michael Pachter is?</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-21T12:52:16+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-21T12:52:16+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>GamerTMTDK</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/GamerTMTDK</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hi.

I\\'m not sure that it will include DLSS technology because it would be an added cost.

I was totally upset and was on my way out of the shopping center where I saw the Xbox series X for sale. Decided to give it a chance.  Bought gamepass and everything was great since I could catch on with some titles I missed previously. But now, after about a year, I regret buying it. There is literally nothing to play. The amount of exclusives and AAA projects is so small that it\\'s just sad. There are some announcements like redfall (which I believe will be a fail), starfield(doubt it will be released any time soon). I just don\\'t believe in Microsoft anymore. Buying blizzard won\\'t change a thing since they are going downhill with their releases lately.\\nSo Am I the only one disappointed? Anyone feels the same?

Thank you for the feedback everyone!</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'m currently trying to decide if I should get an Xbox Series X or PS5. I currently own the Xbox One (original model) and I\\'ve never had a PS3 or 4. I\\'ve been interested in getting a PS5 as there are many exclusives from both PS4 and 5 that I want to play (FF7 Remake, Spider-Man, Ratchet and Clank, Project Diva Future Tone, to name a few)\\nAs for Xbox, there aren\\'t a lot of exclusives I really care about. Halo and Forza are cool but that\\'s all that interests me. The reason I\\'m also considering a Series X is because I do still own a good amount of Xbox games that I haven\\'t played or finished, and my Xbox One is in pretty rough shape. I\\'ve had it for nearly 7 years, and it\\'s a bit beat up. The console often has issues detecting any controller I use so I get controller disconnects frequently, and the console once had a roach problem. Of course, I can just play wired and the Xbox still works, but yeah it\\'s pretty old and beat up.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So basically, it\\'s either upgrade from my old and beat up Xbox One to the new Series X and keep playing my current games on a new and more powerful console, or switch to PS5 and experience a whole new library of games I\\'ve never gotten the chance to play. What do you guys think? I\\'ve been back and forth on which one I should get.</p>\\n]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124582</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124582\" />\\n    <title>Not a serious gamer buy considering an Xbox Series X \u2014 am I making a mistake?</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-24T07:05:18+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-24T07:05:18+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>bocologist</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/bocologist</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&lt;ugh, typo in heading which doesn\\'t seem editable ... but* considering...&gt;</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'m really more of a Nintendo person \u2014\\xa0I like short games, things like Mario Kart, Guitar Hero, Tetris, etc.  Things I can play with family and friends for a half hour here or there.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">However, I don\\'t love the Switch controller; I\\'m partial to a more typical controller shape.

I\\'ve scanned over and over through articles and old reddit posts, and I just cannot come to a decision that works for me. It may end up as a long read so I apologise for that, however any advice that anyone can offer would be hugely appreciated!</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'ve currently got both the XSX and the PS5. I initially started this generation with just the XSX, however towards the end of last year I also bought a PS5, although it\\'s currently being repaired by Sony under warranty due to a faulty fan.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Whilst it\\'s been in warranty though, it\\'s got me thinking that I do not want both consoles. I don\\'t have the time for both as I\\'m a young Dad, and I also don\\'t really have the money to be shelling out for games / subscriptions on both platforms. However I can\\'t decide which one is best for me though!</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'ll pre-empt this by saying I very, very rarely play with friends online, so following what console they\\'re on is not a problem for me.</p>\\n<p lang=\"fy\" dir=\"ltr\">I\\'ll start with what I like about Xbox:</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Firstly, I love Bethesda RPGs. Skyrim is probably my favourite game of all time, and I also love the Fallout games too. Starfield and all future Bethesda games such as Elder Scrolls VI being exclusive to Xbox / Gamepass is a HUGE draw. I also love Forza, and I\\'m invested in the Gears of War and Halo games. Gamepass as a whole is fantastic too. The value is great, especially when you do the Xbox live conversion, and the fact that first party games are going to be available on the service on DAY ONE is another huge draw. Quick resume is awesome and I really like that. Another key point, I currently &quot;game share&quot; with a friend so we have access to eachothers games on the other\\'s console, so there\\'s a big cost saving there. For example, he\\'ll buy Fifa, I\\'ll buy CoD. He\\'ll buy Hogwarts Legacy, I\\'ll buy the new Jedi game, etc. Lastly, I feel like Microsoft is laying good foundations and is going to be the &quot;place to be&quot; for the future of gaming, firstly with the GamePass service, but also with Cloud Gaming (XCloud), and with potential future mergers with Activision for example. They\\'ve also got loads of new studios under their wing, so future first party exclusives could be around the corner.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So all in all, Xbox is a strong contender. However, what I love about PlayStation:</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Their current lineup of exclusives are all fantastic games. Although I will always pick say Starfield over the newest God Of War game, the fact that Sony offer SO many of these great games (TLOU, Horizon, God Of War, Spider-Man, etc) definitely makes it food for thought, especially with the current output of Bethesda games recently too (FO4 came out in 2015 was it? So an 8 year gap to Starfield, and who knows how long until ES VI). Xbox Exclusives in comparison over the last 10 years IMO have gone slightly downhill, especially with games such as Gears of War and Halo, however with all the new Xbox studios, once they\\'re up to speed, they could compete with some of these IPs. The PlayStation Plus service is okay; I know that they don\\'t offer day one first party games, but the lineup is good nevertheless. I love the controller and that truly does feel &quot;next-gen&quot;. I\\'m also under the impression that third party PS games perform better than Xbox games, especially on release anyway. The PS5 is also more popular, so I wonder if instead it\\'s safe to stick to PS for the future as oppose to this new future with Xbox. PlayStation games IMO are more expensive though, and you cannot use sites such as CD Keys to get games at a discounted rate.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So, there we have it. And here I am completely torn down the middle with what system to commit to. What I don\\'t want to happen is pick a platform to commit to and become ingrained in their eco-system, only to then change platforms and have to purchase all old games / hardware all over again.</p>\\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Any advice would be great, especially from people who have maybe been in a similar position in the past and then decided to pick one platform over the other.</p>\\n]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124578</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124578\" />\\n    <title>Would you buy a Nintendo GameCube Classic edition</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-21T23:53:48+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-21T23:53:48+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Lightincable</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/Lightincable</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124577</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124577\" />\\n    <title>Name A better console you Can\u2019t</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-21T19:19:32+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-21T19:19:32+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Lightincable</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/Lightincable</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[]]></content>\\n      </entry>\\n\\n          <entry>\\n    <id>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124576</id>\\n    <link href=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/consoles/124576\" />\\n    <title>How trustfull would you say Michael Pachter is?</title>\\n    <published>2023-03-21T12:52:16+00:00</published>\\n    <updated>2023-03-21T12:52:16+00:00</updated>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>GamerTMTDK</name>\\n      <uri>http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/user/GamerTMTDK</uri>\\n    </author>\\n    <category term=\"consoles\" label=\"consoles\" scheme=\"http://ec2-3-145-99-78.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/\"/>\\n          <content type=\"html\"><![CDATA[<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hi.

I\\'m not sure that it will include DLSS technology because it would be an added cost.
