The issue might be related to how the exception is being handled in the test cases or there might be a logical error in the implementation that prevents the exception from being raised.

The current implementation only pushes operands onto the stack when an operator is encountered, but it should also push the first operand before the loop starts and then push each subsequent operand immediately after processing an operator. Additionally, the implementation does not correctly handle the precedence of operators; it should only apply the operator if the current operator has lower or equal precedence than the operator on the top of the stack, not the other way around. To fix the implementation, we need to ensure that operands are pushed onto the stack at the correct times and that operator precedence is handled correctly.", "The implementation failed two test cases because it does not correctly handle the operator precedence when the current operator has the same precedence as the operator on top of the stack. The current implementation only applies the operator if the operator on top of the stack has a higher precedence than the current operator. However, it should also apply the operator if the operator on top of the stack has the same precedence as the current operator to maintain the left-to-right evaluation order for operators of the same precedence. To overcome this error, we need to change the condition `op_precedence[op_stack[-1]] > op_precedence[operators[i]]` to `op_precedence[op_stack[-1]] >= op_precedence[operators[i]]` so that it also applies the operator when the two operators have the same precedence.", "The implementation failed multiple test cases due to a \"pop from empty list\" error. This error occurs because the `process_stacks` function is called without ensuring that there are enough operands in the `operands_stack`. The implementation incorrectly assumes that there will always be two operands available to pop from the stack, which is not the case when the operator stack is processed before all operands have been pushed. To overcome this error, the algorithm needs to be adjusted to correctly handle the order of operations and ensure that operands are pushed onto the stack at the appropriate times, taking into account the precedence of operators. Additionally, the loop that processes the operators and operands should not be based solely on the length of the operator list, as it fails to push the last operand onto the stack before the loop ends.", "The implementation failed several test cases due to a \"pop from empty list\" error. This error occurs because the function attempts to pop elements from the `operands_stack` when it is empty. The issue is that the function does not push the first operand onto the `operands_stack` before entering the loop that processes the operators and operands. As a result, when the `process_stacks` function is called for the first time, there is only one operand on the stack, leading to an attempt to pop two operands and causing the error. To fix this, the first operand should be pushed onto the `operands_stack` before the loop starts. Additionally, the loop should iterate over the range of the `operand` list, not the `operator` list, to ensure that all operands are processed.", "The implementation failed several test cases due to an IndexError caused by popping from an empty list. This error occurs because the function attempts to process the operators stack without ensuring that there are enough operands in the operands stack. The function does not correctly handle the precedence of operators and does not perform the operations in the correct order. Additionally, the function does not account for the fact that the last operand is not being processed with its corresponding operator. To overcome this error, the function needs to be restructured to correctly handle operator precedence and ensure that operands are processed in pairs with their corresponding operators. The logic to handle the precedence and associativity of operators needs to be correctly implemented, and the operands should be pushed onto the stack after processing the operators, not before.", "The implementation failed several test cases due to an IndexError caused by popping from an empty list. This error occurs because the function attempts to process operators and operands without correctly managing the stacks. The main issue is that the function does not push the first operand onto the operands stack before entering the loop, which causes the operands stack to be empty when the first operator is processed. Additionally, the while loop that processes the stacks based on operator precedence is not correctly implemented, as it does not account for the left-to-right evaluation order for operators of equal precedence. To overcome this error, we need to push the first operand onto the operands stack before the loop and ensure that operators with equal precedence are processed in the correct order, which is from left to right.", "The implementation failed several test cases due to a \"pop from empty list\" error. This error occurs because the function attempts to pop from the `operators_stack` or `operands_stack` when one of them is empty. The issue is that the function does not correctly handle the order of operations and does not correctly manage the stack for operands and operators. Specifically, the function does not push the current operand onto the `operands_stack` before entering the while loop that processes the stack based on operator precedence. As a result, the `operands_stack` is prematurely emptied. To overcome this error, the function should push the current operand onto the `operands_stack` before the while loop that checks and processes the operators based on precedence.

To overcome this error, we need to implement a backtracking algorithm that considers all possible moves at each step and chooses the one that leads to the lexicographically smallest path while also reaching the required path length.", "The implementation failed several test cases because it always starts the path with the smallest number in the grid, which does not guarantee the lexicographically smallest path of length k. The DFS approach does not consider revisiting the starting cell or other cells to minimize the path lexicographically. To overcome this error, the algorithm should be able to start from any cell and consider paths that can revisit cells to ensure the lexicographically smallest sequence is found. Additionally, the current implementation does not handle the case where the path length k is greater than 1 and the grid has a size of 2x2, which requires revisiting cells. The DFS function needs to be adjusted to allow revisiting cells to form a valid path of length k.", "The implementation failed several test cases because it does not correctly handle the requirement that the path can visit the same cell multiple times. The current implementation uses a set to track visited cells and prevents revisiting them, which is incorrect for this problem. The problem allows revisiting cells as long as the total number of cells visited is exactly k. To overcome this error, we should not use a set to track visited cells. Instead, we should allow cells to be revisited and ensure that the length of the path is exactly k, choosing the lexicographically smallest path when there are multiple options.", "The implementation failed several test cases because it does not correctly handle revisiting cells. The current implementation uses a set to keep track of visited cells and never allows revisiting them. However, the problem statement allows revisiting cells as part of the path of length k. The algorithm should be modified to allow revisiting cells, and the visited set should not be used to prevent revisiting. Instead, the algorithm should only ensure that the path length is exactly k and that it chooses the lexicographically smallest path. This can be achieved by not using the visited set to restrict movement and by considering all possible moves at each step until the path length is k.", "The implementation failed several test cases because it does not correctly handle the requirement that the path can visit the same cell multiple times. The current implementation uses a set to keep track of visited cells and prevents revisiting them, which is incorrect according to the problem statement. To overcome this error, we should not use a set to track visited cells, allowing the path to include the same cell more than once if it leads to a lexicographically smaller path. Additionally, the priority queue should prioritize paths based on their lexicographical order rather than the sum of the values, which is not a requirement of the problem.", "The implementation failed some test cases because it does not properly handle revisiting cells. The algorithm is designed to find the minimum path of length k without revisiting cells, as it uses a set to keep track of visited cells. However, the problem statement allows revisiting cells, which means the algorithm should be able to include the same cell multiple times in the path if necessary. The current implementation only considers paths that visit unique cells, which leads to incorrect results when the optimal path requires revisiting cells. To overcome this error, the algorithm should be modified to allow paths to revisit cells and not use a set to track visited cells, or it should use a different approach to track the number of visits to each cell while still allowing revisits.", "The implementation failed several test cases because it does not correctly handle revisiting cells.
