The `sum()` function expects an iterable of numbers as its argument, but in this case, it is being used on a list of lists. To fix this error, we need to modify the `key` parameter of the `sorted()` function to use a lambda function that calculates the sum of the inner lists instead of using the `sum()` function directly.

This will handle the case where the shift count is invalid and prevent the \"negative shift count\" error.", "The implementation failed 4 out of the 6 test cases. The issue lies in the logic of the for loop. The loop iterates n times and in each iteration, it rotates the string s by moving the last character to the front. However, this rotation does not guarantee that the resulting binary number will be different from the original. As a result, the count is not incremented correctly. To fix this, we need to check if the rotated string is different from the original before incrementing the count. This can be done by comparing the rotated string with the original string using the \"!=\" operator.", "The implementation failed the tests due to a \"negative shift count\" error. This error occurs when the shift count (n) is greater than the length of the binary string (len(s)). To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the shift count is within the bounds of the binary string. We can do this by using the modulo operator (%) to wrap the shift count around the length of the string. This can be done by modifying the line `rotated_num = (num << n) | (num >> (len(s) - n))` to `rotated_num = (num << (n % len(s))) | (num >> (len(s) - (n % len(s))))`.

It simply rotates the string by moving the last character to the front, without considering the length constraint. To fix this, we need to add a check to ensure that the length of the string is equal to or less than n before performing the rotation. If the length is greater, we can truncate the string to the first n characters before rotating.", "The implementation failed one of the test cases. The issue lies in the rotate function, where it rotates the binary string n times by concatenating the substring from index n onwards with the substring from index 0 to n.
