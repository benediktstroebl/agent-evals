The issue lies in the loop range and the condition to check if a number starts and ends with 1. The loop range should be adjusted to consider all n-digit numbers properly, and the condition should ensure that the number is exactly n-digits long. To fix this, the loop range should be from 10**(n-1) to 10**n - 1, and the condition should be if len(str(i)) == n and str(i)[0] == '1' and str(i)[-1] == '1'.", "MCTS reflections"], "implementations": ["def starts_one_ends(n):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):\n        if str(i)[0] == '1' or str(i)[-1] == '1':\n            count += 1\n    return count", "def starts_one_ends(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit\n    positive integers that start or end with 1.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(10**(n-1), 10**n):\n        if '1' in str(i):\n            count += 1\n    return count"], "test_feedback": ["Tested passed:\n# assert starts_one_ends(-1) == 0, \"Failed on negative number\"\nassert starts_one_ends(2) == 18, \"Failed on two-digit numbers\"\n# assert starts_one_ends(0) == 0, \"Failed on non-positive integer\"\n\nTests failed:\nassert starts_one_ends(1) == 2, \"Failed on single-digit numbers\" # output: 1\nassert starts_one_ends(5) == 1900, \"Failed on larger numbers\" # output: 18000\nassert starts_one_ends(3) == 190, \"Failed on three-digit numbers\" # output: 180", "Tested passed:\n# assert starts_one_ends(-1) == 0, \"Failed on negative number\"\n# assert starts_one_ends(0) == 0, \"Failed on non-positive integer\"\n\nTests failed:\nassert starts_one_ends(1) == 2, \"Failed on single-digit numbers\" # output: 1\nassert starts_one_ends(2) == 18, \"Failed on two-digit numbers\" # output: 1\nassert starts_one_ends(5) == 1900, \"Failed on larger numbers\" # output: 1000\nassert starts_one_ends(3) == 190, \"Failed on three-digit numbers\" # output: 10"], "acc": 0.52}
