The issue is caused by incorrect formatting and indentation in the provided code snippet. To fix this error, I should ensure that all delimiters are properly closed and the code is formatted correctly. Next time I approach the problem, I will pay more attention to the code structure and formatting to avoid such compilation errors."], "solution": "// You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.\n// Find the longest subsequence of nums that meets the following requirements:\n// The subsequence is strictly increasing and\n// The difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence is at most k.\n// Return the length of the longest subsequence that meets the requirements.\n// A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.\nfn length_of_lis(nums: Vec<i32>, k: i32) -> i32 {\n    let n = nums.len();\n    if n == 0 {\n        return 0;\n    }\n\n    let mut dp = vec![1; n];\n\n    for i in 1..n {\n        for j in 0..i {\n            if nums[i] > nums[j] && nums[i] - nums[j] <= k {\n                dp[i] = dp[i].max(dp[j] + 1);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    dp.into_iter().max().unwrap_or(0)\n}"}
