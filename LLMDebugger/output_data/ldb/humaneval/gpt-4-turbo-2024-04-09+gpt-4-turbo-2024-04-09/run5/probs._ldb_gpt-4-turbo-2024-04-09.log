It defines a nested function `digit_sum` that computes the sum of the digits of the absolute value of a given integer. The main list `nums` is then sorted using Python's built-in `sorted()` function, with a lambda function as the key. This lambda function uses `enumerate` to keep track of the original indices of the elements, and sorts primarily by the digit sum (`digit_sum(x[1])`), secondarily by whether the number is negative (`x[1] < 0`), and tertiarily by the original index (`x[0]`) in case of ties in the digit sum and sign.\n\nThis corrected function should now pass the unit test and sort the numbers as expected based on the sum of their digits, while prioritizing negative numbers and preserving the order of numbers with equal digit sums and signs based on their original positions.", "inference_time": 29.841121435165405, "model_name": "gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09", "prompt_tokens": 2406, "completion_tokens": 387, "total_tokens": 2793, "type": "api_call"}

This approach ensures that operations like multiplication and division are handled before addition and subtraction, according to standard operator precedence rules.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the function:\n\n```python\ndef do_algebra(operators, operands):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given two lists operators, and operands. The first list has basic algebra operations, and \n    the second list is a list of integers. Use the two given lists to build the algebraic \n    expression and return the evaluation of this expression.\n\n    The basic algebra operations:\n    Addition ( + ) \n    Subtraction ( - ) \n    Multiplication ( * ) \n    Floor division ( // ) \n    Exponentiation ( ** ) \n\n    Example:\n    operators = ['+', '*', '-']\n    operands = [2, 3, 4, 5]\n    result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5\n    => result = 9\n\n    Note:\n        The length of operators list is equal to the length of operands list minus one.\n        Operands is a list of non-negative integers.\n        Operators list has at least one operator, and operands list has at least two operands.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not operators or len(operands) <= 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"Invalid input: operators must have at least one element and operands must have at least two elements.\")\n\n    # Construct the expression as a string\n    expression = str(operands[0])\n    for op, num in zip(operators, operands[1:]):\n        expression += f\" {op} {num}\"\n\n    # Evaluate the expression using eval to respect operator precedence\n    result = eval(expression)\n\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nresult = do_algebra(['+', '*', '-'], [2, 3, 4, 5])\nprint(\"Result:\", result)  # Output should be 9\n```\n\nThis version of the function constructs a string representing the algebraic expression and then evaluates it using Python's `eval()` function. This approach correctly handles operator precedence, ensuring that multiplication and division are processed before addition and subtraction, as expected in standard arithmetic operations.", "inference_time": 24.179651975631714, "model_name": "gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09", "prompt_tokens": 2033, "completion_tokens": 467, "total_tokens": 2500, "type": "api_call"}
