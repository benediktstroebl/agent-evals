We'll check both possible concatenations of the strings:\n   - First string followed by the second string.\n   - Second string followed by the first string.\n3. A string is balanced during traversal if at no point the number of closing parentheses exceeds the number of opening ones.\n\nLet's implement the solution:\n\n```python\ndef match_parens(lst):\n    def is_balanced(s1, s2):\n        \"\"\" Helper function to check if concatenating s1 with s2 results in a balanced string \"\"\"\n        balance = 0\n        for char in s1 + s2:\n            if char == '(':\n                balance += 1\n            else:\n                balance -= 1\n            if balance < 0:\n                return False\n        return balance == 0\n\n    # Extract the two strings\n    first, second = lst[0], lst[1]\n\n    # Check both concatenations\n    if is_balanced(first, second) or is_balanced(second, first):\n        return 'Yes'\n    else:\n        return 'No'\n\n# Unit test\nassert match_parens(['()(', ')']) == 'Yes'\n```\n\nThis code checks whether concatenating the two strings in either order results in a balanced string. The `is_balanced` function checks if the concatenated string remains balanced throughout its length, and returns `True` if it does and `False` otherwise. The main function then returns 'Yes' if either order of concatenation is balanced, and 'No' otherwise.", "inference_time": 25.691499710083008, "model_name": "gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09", "prompt_tokens": 216, "completion_tokens": 379, "total_tokens": 595, "type": "api_call", "temperature": 0.5}

If it fails (raises a `ValueError`), the function returns `False` immediately. If the parsing succeeds, it further checks the validity of the day and month values, including handling leap years for February.\n\nWe can also test this function with your provided unit test and additional edge cases to ensure it behaves as expected:\n\n```python\n# Provided unit test\nassert valid_date('03-11-2000') == True\n\n# Additional test cases\nassert valid_date('15-01-2012') == False  # Invalid format (day-month-year)\nassert valid_date('04-0-2040') == False   # Invalid day (zero)\nassert valid_date('06-04-2020') == True   # Valid date\nassert valid_date('06/04/2020') == False  # Invalid format (slashes used)\nassert valid_date('02-29-2004') == True   # Leap year, valid date\nassert valid_date('02-29-2003') == False  # Not a leap year, invalid date\n```\n\nThis implementation and tests help ensure the `valid_date` function works correctly across various scenarios.", "inference_time": 28.551012754440308, "model_name": "gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09", "prompt_tokens": 311, "completion_tokens": 629, "total_tokens": 940, "type": "api_call", "temperature": 0.5}

Hence, any number less than 8 cannot be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers.\n\nFor numbers greater than or equal to 8, we need to check if the number is even. This is because the sum of even numbers is always even. If \\( n \\) is not even, it cannot be expressed as the sum of four even numbers. If \\( n \\) is even and greater than or equal to 8, then it can be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers, since we can always use the number 2 to adjust the sum to \\( n \\).\n\nHere is the Python function implementing this logic:\n\n```python\ndef is_equal_to_sum_even(n):\n    \"\"\"Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers\n    Example\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False\n    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if n is less than 8 or odd\n    if n < 8 or n % 2 != 0:\n        return False\n    # Check if n is even and at least 8\n    else:\n        return True\n\n# Unit test\nassert is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False\n```\n\nThis function first checks if \\( n \\) is less than 8 or odd, in which case it returns `False`. If \\( n \\) is even and at least 8, it returns `True`, indicating that \\( n \\) can indeed be expressed as the sum of four even numbers. The provided unit test checks the condition for \\( n = 4 \\), which correctly returns `False` as expected.", "inference_time": 26.703752994537354, "model_name": "gpt-4-turbo-2024-04-09", "prompt_tokens": 123, "completion_tokens": 446, "total_tokens": 569, "type": "api_call", "temperature": 0.5}
