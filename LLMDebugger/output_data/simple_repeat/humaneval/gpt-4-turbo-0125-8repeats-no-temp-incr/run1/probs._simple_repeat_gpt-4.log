If at any point the counter goes negative, it means a closing bracket has appeared without a corresponding opening bracket before it, which is incorrect. Also, if the counter is not zero at the end, it means there are unmatched opening brackets. Here's how you can implement this:\n\n```python\ndef correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    brackets is a string of \"(\" and \")\".\n    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.\n\n    >>> correct_bracketing(\"(\")\n    False\n    >>> correct_bracketing(\"()\")\n    True\n    >>> correct_bracketing(\"(()())\")\n    True\n    >>> correct_bracketing(\")(()\")\n    False\n    \"\"\"\n    counter = 0\n    for bracket in brackets:\n        if bracket == '(':\n            counter += 1\n        elif bracket == ')':\n            counter -= 1\n        if counter < 0:\n            return False\n    return counter == 0\n\n# Unit test\nassert correct_bracketing('(') == False\n```\n\nThis function iterates through each character in the input string, adjusting the counter based on whether the character is an opening or closing bracket. It immediately returns `False` if the counter goes negative, and finally checks if the counter is zero to ensure all brackets are correctly matched.", "inference_time": 37.06777095794678, "model_name": "azure-agent-eval-gpt-4", "prompt_tokens": 133, "completion_tokens": 313, "total_tokens": 446, "type": "api_call"}

This step ensures that if the `shift` is greater than the number of digits, the operation still behaves correctly by effectively reducing the `shift` to a meaningful value within the range of the number's length.\n\nThe circular shift is performed by slicing the string: the last `effective_shift` digits are moved to the front, and the rest are appended after them.

A key insight is that for an array to be sortable by right shifts, it must consist of at most one descending sequence when viewed in a circular manner. This is because a single right shift moves the last element to the front, effectively handling cases where there's a single \"wrap-around\" from the highest to the lowest element. If there are two or more points where the array goes from a higher to a lower value (excluding the sorted case), it cannot be sorted with right shifts alone.\n\nHere's how we can implement this logic in Python:\n\n```python\ndef move_one_ball(arr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if it's possible to sort the array in non-decreasing order by performing\n    right shift operations.\n    \"\"\"\n    # If the array is empty or has a single element, it's considered sorted.\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return True\n    \n    # Count the number of times the array goes from a higher to a lower value.\n    desc_count = 0\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        # Compare each element with the next one, considering the array as circular.\n        if arr[i] > arr[(i + 1) % len(arr)]:\n            desc_count += 1\n        # If there are more than one descending sequences, it cannot be sorted with right shifts.\n        if desc_count > 1:\n            return False\n    \n    # If the loop completes with desc_count <= 1, the array can be sorted with right shifts.\n    return True\n\n# Unit test\nassert move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2]) == True\n```\n\nThis function iterates through the array once, checking each element against the next, treating the array as circular by using modulo arithmetic. If it finds more than one descending sequence, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`, indicating the array can be sorted with right shifts.", "inference_time": 20.696470499038696, "model_name": "azure-agent-eval-gpt-4", "prompt_tokens": 355, "completion_tokens": 420, "total_tokens": 775, "type": "api_call"}

In this controlled scenario, it should be fine, but I'll also outline a safer approach that doesn't use `eval`.\n\nHere's a solution using string manipulation and `eval`:\n\n```python\ndef do_algebra(operators, operands):\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluate the algebraic expression defined by the operators and operands lists.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Start with the first operand as the initial part of the expression\n    expression = str(operands[0])\n    \n    # Iterate over the operators and the remaining operands\n    for op, val in zip(operators, operands[1:]):\n        # Append the operator and operand to the expression string\n        expression += f\" {op} {val}\"\n    \n    # Evaluate and return the expression\n    return eval(expression)\n\n# Unit test\nassert do_algebra(['+', '*', '-'], [2, 3, 4, 5]) == 9\n```\n\nFor a safer approach that doesn't use `eval`, you can manually apply each operation. This requires a bit more code but avoids the potential security risks of `eval`:\n\n```python\ndef do_algebra(operators, operands):\n    \"\"\"\n    Evaluate the algebraic expression defined by the operators and operands lists without using eval.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Start with the first operand\n    result = operands[0]\n    \n    # Iterate over the operators and the remaining operands\n    for op, val in zip(operators, operands[1:]):\n        if op == '+':\n            result += val\n        elif op == '-':\n            result -= val\n        elif op == '*':\n            result *= val\n        elif op == '//':\n            result //= val\n        elif op == '**':\n            result **= val\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(f\"Unsupported operator: {op}\")\n    \n    return result\n\n# Unit test\nassert do_algebra(['+', '*', '-'], [2, 3, 4, 5]) == 9\n```\n\nThis second approach manually applies each operation based on the operator, which is safer and avoids the use of `eval`.", "inference_time": 25.69811701774597, "model_name": "azure-agent-eval-gpt-4", "prompt_tokens": 266, "completion_tokens": 501, "total_tokens": 767, "type": "api_call"}
